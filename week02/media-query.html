            <h2>Jacob 3:1</h2>
            <p>But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart. Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto
            him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send down
            justice upon those who seek your destruction.</p>

            <h2>Eter 12:27</h2>
            <p>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my
            grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have
            faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>
